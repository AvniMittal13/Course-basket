# Course and Credit Management System - KAMAND BASKET
This web-app helps in course management by keeping a track of pending and completed courses and credits from each domain, namely - IC Core courses, Free Electives, Discipline Electives, Science Baskets and Discipline core courses.
Suggests courses according to your-

ongoing semester [only the courses that are being offered for your branch and semester number]
interests [will recommend HSS courses that count towards satisfying minor in management requirements if mentioned as interest]

Along with this, it provides space to plan your courses and a discussion forum to ask seniors for advice :)
